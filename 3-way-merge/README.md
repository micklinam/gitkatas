# Git Kata: 3-Way Merge

## The task
You again live in your own branch, this time we will be doing a bit of juggling with branches, to show how lightweight branches are in git.

1. Run `. setup.sh`
1. Create a branch called greeting and check it out
1. Edit the greeting.txt to contain your favorite greeting
1. Add greeting.txt files to staging area using patch mode
1. Commit
1. Switch back to the master branch
1. Create a file README.md with information about this repository
1. Try adding README.md file to staging area using patch mode (it wont work)
1. What is the output of `git status`?
1. Add the README.md file to staging area and make the commit
1. What is the output of `git log --oneline --decorate --graph --all`?
1. Diff the branches
1. Merge the greeting branch into master

## Useful commands
- `git branch`
- `git branch <branch-name>`
- `git branch -d <branch-name>`
- `git checkout <branch-name>`
- `git checkout -b <branch-name>`
- `git branch -v`
- `git add`
- `git add -p`
- `git commit`
