# Git Katas

## Quick Start

![Quick Start](/images/quickstart.gif)

- Clone this repository
- Go into the folder you want to solve an exercise in
- Run the `setup.sh` script
- Consult the README.md in that folder to get a description of the exercise

## Purpose of Git Katas

This repository is a collection of Git exercises.
The concept is stolen without shame from [Schauderhaft.de](http://blog.schauderhaft.de/gitkata/).
Unfortunately, they have not maintained the system - and we need more good Git exercises.

The exercises are designed for use when we are teaching Git courses. You should be able to use them as self-contained exercises that will allow you to keep your Git skills sharp.

Exercises starting with _basic_ are entry-level - other exercises vary greatly in difficulty.

To get an overview of the exercises in here look in [Overview.md](Overview.md).

Feel free to use these exercises, that's why they're public!


## Contributing

If you miss exercises or find errors in any of them, feel free to improve them and make a pull request.

You can also make an issue so we notice an opportunity to improve!

Thank you!
